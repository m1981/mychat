# Technical Motivations

## Server-Sent Events (SSE) Implementation

### Why SSE for AI Response Streaming?

Our system uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the primary streaming protocol for AI response delivery. Here are the technical motivations behind this choice:

1. **Architectural Alignment**
   ```
   AI Provider -> Our Backend -> Frontend
   ```
   - One-way data flow matches SSE's design
   - Backend acts as transformer between HTTP chunks and SSE
   - Clean separation of concerns in data delivery

2. **Protocol Benefits**
   - Simpler than WebSocket (no handshake required)
   - Built-in reconnection handling
   - Native browser support via `EventSource`
   - Automatic event ordering with IDs
   - Connection health monitoring via heartbeats

3. **AI Provider Integration**
   - Compatible with both OpenAI and Anthropic streaming
   - Easy transformation of provider chunks to SSE format:
   ```typescript
   // Provider chunk -> SSE format
   res.write(`data: ${JSON.stringify(chunk)}\n\n`);
   ```

4. **Standardized Message Format**
   ```
   data: {"content": "Hello"}
   data: {"content": "World"}
   data: [DONE]
   ```
   - Consistent parsing across different providers
   - Easy to extend for new message types
   - Clear stream termination signals

5. **Performance Considerations**
   - Lower overhead than WebSocket
   - No need to maintain bi-directional state
   - Efficient for text-based streaming
   - Browser handles connection management

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Straightforward debugging (plain text format)
   - Easy to implement on both ends
   - Well-documented standard
   - Familiar to frontend developers

7. **Reliability Features**
   - Automatic reconnection by browser
   - Connection health monitoring
   - Clear error handling patterns
   - Resilient to network issues

### Alternative Considerations

While other protocols were considered, SSE proved optimal for our use case:

| Protocol | Why Not Chosen |
|----------|---------------|
| WebSocket | Overkill for one-way streaming, more complex |
| HTTP Polling | Higher latency, more server load |
| Long Polling | More complex implementation, higher overhead |
| Raw HTTP Streaming | Less standardized, no built-in features |

### Future Considerations

The SSE implementation provides good foundation for future enhancements:
- Easy to add new event types
- Can be extended for different AI providers
- Supports metadata in events
- Allows for custom retry logic
