1. Addressing Complex Dependencies
   Targeted Test Doubles: Created focused mocks that only implement what's needed
   Dependency Factory: Added a createDependencies() function to consistently generate test dependencies
   Explicit Injection: Clearly injected all dependencies to avoid implicit dependencies

2. Handling Side Effects
   Isolated Verification: Verified each side effect separately
   Step-by-Step Testing: Checked state transitions in sequence
   Mocked External Services: Used mocks for API calls and storage operations

3. Managing Global State
   Reset Before Each Test: Reset global state before each test
   Verify State Changes: Explicitly verified global state changes
   Isolated Tests: Ensured tests don't affect each other through global state

4. Tackling Callback Nesting
   Focused Scenarios: Broke down complex functions into smaller test scenarios
   State Transition Testing: Verified each step in the process
   Mocked Sub-Functions: Used mocks to isolate specific parts of the callback chain


5. Dealing with Large Function Size
   Scenario-Based Testing: Created specific test scenarios for different paths
   Focused Test Cases: Each test verifies a specific behavior
   Progressive Verification: Verified state at each important step
   Key Testing Principles Applied
   Isolation: Each test is independent and doesn't rely on other tests
   Determinism: Tests produce the same results each time they run
   Readability: Tests clearly show what's being tested and expected
   Maintainability: Tests are structured to be resilient to implementation changes
   Coverage: Tests cover happy paths, error paths, and edge cases

6. Keep Tests READABLE
- Write clear, descriptive test names (e.g., "should_calculate_total_price_with_discount")
- Use meaningful variable names
- Structure tests in Given-When-Then format
- Make test intention obvious

2. Keep Tests ISOLATED
- Each test should be independent
- No dependencies between tests
- Tests should be able to run in any order
- Clean up after each test

3. Test ONE THING at a time
- One logical assertion per test
- Test single behavior/feature
- Avoid testing multiple scenarios in one test
- Keep tests focused

4. Write MAINTAINABLE tests
- Don't duplicate test code (use setup methods)
- Keep test code simple
- Update tests when requirements change
- Remove obsolete tests

5. Test BEHAVIOR, not implementation
- Focus on what, not how
- Test public interfaces
- Don't test private methods
- Write tests from user's perspective
