# Testing Principles Guide

## Core Testing Principles

1. **Test Isolation**
   - Each test must be independent and able to run in any order
   - Reset global state before each test
   - Use targeted test doubles that only implement what's needed
   - Explicitly inject all dependencies to avoid implicit dependencies
   - Clean up after each test

2. **Test Readability**
   - Write clear, descriptive test names (e.g., "should_calculate_total_price_with_discount")
   - Structure tests in Given-When-Then format
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Make test intention obvious

3. **Behavior-Focused Testing**
   - Test public interfaces, not implementation details
   - Focus on what, not how
   - Write tests from user's perspective
   - Verify outcomes rather than implementation steps
   - Don't test private methods directly

4. **Maintainability**
   - Don't duplicate test code (use setup methods)
   - Keep test code simple and focused
   - Update tests when requirements change
   - Remove obsolete tests
   - Use dependency factories to consistently generate test dependencies

5. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Test happy paths, error paths, and edge cases
   - Verify state transitions at each important step
   - Create specific test scenarios for different paths in complex functions
   - Test one logical assertion per test
   - Break down complex functions into smaller test scenarios

## Strategies for Common Testing Challenges

1. **Addressing Complex Dependencies**
   - Create focused mocks that only implement what's needed
   - Add dependency factories to consistently generate test dependencies
   - Clearly inject all dependencies to avoid implicit dependencies

2. **Handling Side Effects**
   - Verify each side effect separately
   - Check state transitions in sequence
   - Use mocks for API calls and storage operations

3. **Managing Global State**
   - Reset global state before each test
   - Explicitly verify global state changes
   - Ensure tests don't affect each other through global state

4. **Tackling Callback Nesting**
   - Break down complex functions into smaller test scenarios
   - Verify each step in the process
   - Use mocks to isolate specific parts of the callback chain

5. **Dealing with Large Function Size**
   - Create specific test scenarios for different paths
   - Verify state at each important step
   - Focus each test on a specific behavior
