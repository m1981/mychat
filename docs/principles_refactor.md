Here are the key practices to follow during architectural refactoring:

1. Incremental Changes
- Make small, manageable changes
- Keep the system working at all times
- Use feature toggles for bigger changes
- Implement changes gradually

2. Strong Test Coverage
- Add tests before refactoring
- Ensure all critical paths are covered
- Use integration tests for boundaries

3. Clear Documentation
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Keep diagrams updated
- Document migration steps

4. Code Practices
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use design patterns appropriately
- Maintain clean code
