# Refactoring Plan: Provider Architecture

## Current Status (Updated)

### Completed Changes
1. **Interface Definition**:
   - ✅ Created `AIProviderInterface` with clear method signatures
   - ✅ Updated method signatures to match requirements

2. **Provider Context**:
   - ✅ Added `ProviderContext.tsx` with React context for provider access
   - ✅ Implemented `useProvider` hook for components to access the current provider

3. **Provider Implementation**:
   - ✅ Updated `providers.ts` to implement the new interface for OpenAI and Anthropic
   - ✅ Made providers use `ProviderRegistry` for configuration

4. **Hook Refactoring**:
   - ✅ Updated `useTitleGeneration` to use the provider context
   - ✅ Created `useChatCompletion` hook with provider context

5. **App Integration**:
   - ✅ Added `ProviderProvider` to `App.tsx` to wrap the application

## Simplified Approach
Based on feedback, we've simplified the implementation to focus on the core requirements:

1. **Reduced Abstraction Layers**:
   - Removed unnecessary service classes
   - Integrated logic directly into hooks where appropriate
   - Simplified the provider context implementation

2. **Direct Provider Access**:
   - Replaced direct provider access with context-based access
   - Ensured all provider-specific logic is contained in provider implementations

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Implemented dependency injection through React context
   - Components now receive providers through context rather than direct imports

## Next Actions

1. **Testing**:
   - Test the title generation flow with different providers
   - Verify error handling works correctly

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments explaining the dependency injection pattern
   - Document the provider interface for future extensions

3. **Clean Up**:
   - Remove any unused code or commented-out sections
   - Ensure consistent naming and coding style

## Current Focus
- Testing the implementation with different providers
- Ensuring all components use the provider context correctly

## Timeline
- Phase 1: Core refactoring (COMPLETED)
- Phase 2: Integration and testing (IN PROGRESS)
- Phase 3: Documentation and cleanup (PENDING)

## Specific Code Tasks

### Complete TitleGenerator.ts:
- Implement the remaining methods for prompt formatting and response extraction
- Add proper error handling

### Update useTitleGeneration.ts:
- Complete the refactoring to use the provider context
- Remove any remaining direct access to global state

### Test Provider Integration:
- Ensure the provider context is correctly passed down
- Verify that the correct provider is used based on the current selection

### Update Submission Flow:
- Ensure title generation is triggered at the right time in the submission flow
- Verify it works with the new architecture
