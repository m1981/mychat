# Test Mode Implementation Plan

## Business Requirements (BDD)
Given I am a developer working on the chat application
When I need to test the UI and functionality
Then I should be able to run the application in test mode
And see simulated responses without calling real APIs

Given the application is running in test mode
When I send a message
Then I should see a simulated streaming response
And the UI should behave exactly as it does with real API calls
And no actual API calls should be made

Given I am running tests
When test mode is enabled
Then all API-dependent functionality should use mock data
And the application should maintain full interactivity

## Implementation Steps for Missing Features

1. Realistic Response Formatting
   - Add markdown formatting to simulated responses
   - Include code blocks and lists
   - Simulate different response lengths

2. Error Simulation
   - Add random error injection
   - Simulate API timeout scenarios
   - Simulate rate limiting errors
   - Add network failure scenarios

3. Network Latency
   - Implement configurable delay patterns
   - Simulate varying network conditions
   - Add jitter to response timing

4. Model-Specific Patterns
   - Simulate different model response styles
   - Add model-specific tokens and formatting
   - Implement model-specific rate limits

5. Stop Generation
   - Implement proper stream termination
   - Add cleanup handlers
   - Simulate partial response handling

6. Regenerate Response
   - Implement different response variations
   - Maintain context consistency
   - Handle history updates

7. Chat History
   - Implement local storage simulation
   - Add history navigation handling
   - Simulate data persistence

8. Title Generation
   - Add mock title generation logic
   - Implement title updates
   - Handle title generation errors

## Notes
- Test mode should be easily toggled via environment variables
- All simulated behaviors should mimic production behavior
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Consider adding test-specific UI indicators
